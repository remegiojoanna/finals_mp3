            <p>We could leave the Christmas lights up <br>
            ‘Til January <br>
            This is our place, we make the rules <br>
            And there’s a dazzling haze <br>
            A mysterious way about you, dear <br>
            Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?</p>

            <p>Can I go where you go? <br>
            Can we always be this close? <br>
            Forever and ever <br>
            Take me out <br>
            And take me home <br>
            You’re my, my, my, my... <br>
            Lover</p>

            <p>We could light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, baby <br>
            Pictures of when we were young <br>
            Would hang on the wall <br>
            We would sit on the stoop <br>
            I’ll sing love songs to you when we’re eighty <br>
            See I finally got you now, honey <br>
            I won’t let you fall</p>

            <p>Can I go where you go? <br>
            Can we always be this close? <br>
            Forever and ever <br>
            Take me out <br>
            And take me home <br>
            You’re my, my, my, my... <br>
            Lover</p>

            <p>Ladies and gentlemen <br>
            Will you please stand <br>
            With every guitar string scar on my hand <br>
            I take this magnetic force of a man <br>
            To be my lover</p>

            <p>Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth <br>
            The girl in my story, has always been you <br>
            I’d go down with the Titanic, it’s true <br>
            For you… <br>
            Lover</p>

            <p>And you’ll save all your dirtiest jokes <br>
            For me <br>
            And at every table, I’ll save you a seat <br>
            Lover…</p>

            <p>Can I go where you go? <br>
            Can we always be this close? <br>
            Forever and ever <br>
            Take me out <br>
            And take me home <br>
            You’re my, my, my, my... <br>
            Oh you’re my, my, my, my... <br>
            Darling you’re my, my, my, my... <br>
            Lover</p>
